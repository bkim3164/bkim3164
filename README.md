# Hi, I'm Brian Kim 👋

I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science student at UC Irvine and a Software Engineering Intern at AVEVA, where I develop scalable testing infrastructure to improve software reliability. I’m passionate about building clean, maintainable systems, solving challenging technical problems, and learning new technologies that make development more efficient. Outside of work, I’m an avid 2100-rated chess player who enjoys applying strategic thinking both on and off the board.
